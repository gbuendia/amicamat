# amicamat
A small python script that prints today's verse of _Llibre d'Amic e Amat_ by Ramon Llull.

## The book
It's a collection of mystic verses about the relationship between Man and God written in the 13. century.
The author incorporated the it inside his later book _Blanquerna_ as if it was a book commisioned to the protagonist.
The fictional author claims each verse to be enough meditation material for a whole day, and there's one verse for every day of the year.
