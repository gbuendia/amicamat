# amicamat
A small python script that prints "today"'s verse of _Llibre d'Amic e Amat_ by the 13. century mystic
[Ramon Llull](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramon_Llull).

## The book
It's a collection of verses about the relationship between Man and God which the author incorporated inside his later novel
_[Blanquerna](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blanquerna)_ as if it was a book commisioned to the protagonist.
The fictional author claims each verse to be enough meditation material for a whole day,
and there's one verse for every day of the year.

### The text
The complete text for this script was taken from [Wikisource](https://ca.wikisource.org/wiki/Llibre_d'Amic_e_Amat), where it's published with a Creative Commons [cc-by-sa](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/deed.en) licence.
